Writing basic node scripts in TypeScript can be a fiddly experience - sure you can install TS node globally, but then if you want to do any debugging within VScode, with breakpoints etc it becomes annoying. That's why I just snapped and created this [starter](https://github.com/falqas/starter) repo that handles it for you. I clone this and use it for most of my scripts this way.
