Organizing principle of RC is self-direction
The RC self-directives:
- Work at the edge of your abilities - enough to challenge rather than demotivate yourself
- Build your volitional muscles - learn based on curiosity and joy rather than external pressures; like any muscle, it grows when exercised
- Learn generously - be open to collaboration, set aside fears about experience; "pair soon, pair often, and with more people".

Here's the advice folks shared at advice and intros this afternoon (paraphrased somewhat as I was trying to get it all down!). If anyone has more advice to share, please do!

Liz: Pick a public accountability mechanism and stick to it!

Jacob Y: If you’re doing RC remotely, don’t be afraid to create an interest group or way to talk to people remotely!

Russ S: RC is a good place to figure out your own operator’s manual. If you find you’re not getting as much done as you want it’s a good place to experiment.

Pris: Remember you have a body: hydrate, rest, if you're colocated with other RCers do walking one on ones, etc.!

Erika: It’s okay to do less — you may end up finding there are too many things that are exciting and interesting. Highly recommend BYVM exercise later in the batch ([Friday!](https://www.recurse.com/calendar/23371 "https://www.recurse.com/calendar/23371"))

Rob S: Be excited to join interest groups and also excited to stop joining interest groups! There will reach a point where you feel like you’re taking too many classes.

Russ W: A little self-serving but if you’re one of the folks interested in ML, look into the ML groups that are currently going on and also the education materials alums (Russ!) have been providing!

Garrett: It’s really incredible how you can ask people for advice and help. I don’t have a ton of experience and it’s been really cool to be like ‘hey, i don’t understand this thing at all’ and have really cool accomplished people respond. It really accelerates your learning.

Chris G: Make sure to put yourself out there and try to meet people because everyone is really kind and awesome.

Neda: First week might be overwhelming and exciting; enjoy exploring different things! I recommend going to coffee chats to get to know people on a one on one basis, especially if you’re remote.

Piya: Take some time at the end of every week to reflect on how your week went, so you can figure out what your future weeks should look like. Reflection time is really important!
