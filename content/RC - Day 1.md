Organizing principle of RC is self-direction
The RC self-directives:
- Work at the edge of your abilities - enough to challenge rather than demotivate yourself
- Build your volitional muscles - learn based on curiosity and joy rather than external pressures; like any muscle, it grows when exercised
- Learn generously - be open to collaboration, set aside fears about experience; "pair soon, pair often, and with more people".
