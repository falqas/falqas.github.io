There are two types of synecdoche:
- When a part of something is used to refer to the whole. - e.g. "Nice set of wheels" when referring to a car, or "nice server" when referring to the hardware :)
- When a whole of something is used to refer to a part - e.g. "Let's go to the movies" when referring to a single movie at a theater)
