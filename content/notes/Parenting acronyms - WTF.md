When my wife and I were expecting our first child, we spent a lot of time reading parenting forums with two laptops - one for browsing, and one for looking up the various acronyms and code words. These ranged from the confusing (POAS = "pee on a stick", ie "take a pregnancy test"), to the juvenile (embabies = "embryos"), to the just plain awful (DH = "Dearest Husband").

At best, coded language like this is just harmless & silly, but at worst it can come across as gatekeeping and unwelcoming.

Now you might turn around and say "user error - [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)" Well we've been trying! But over a year later, we _still_ find ourselves looking up some of these acronyms! So I finally wrote a Chrome extension that does a simple text replacement of some of these terms: [Abbrevihater](https://github.com/falqas/abbrevihater), (please help me find a less incendiary name...) a fork of [another inspirational](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) browser extension.

I also added a few that, while not necessarily confusing, I'd be glad to never see again (looking at you, "girl dad").

Anyways - check it out [here!](https://github.com/falqas/abbrevihater) You may have to manually install by going to "Manage Extensions -> Load Unpacked" (ensure "Developer Mode" is enabled) and selecting the directory.
