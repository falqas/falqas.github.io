I'm [Faisal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/falqas/), a Software Engineer based in New York City. I'm full stack, but am drawn to work that involves the backend and lots of data. I love building tools that make people's lives easier and less stressful. I'm also interested in both hardware hacking and language learning. Sometimes I write about what I'm learning, and other times, I learn about what I'm writing.
